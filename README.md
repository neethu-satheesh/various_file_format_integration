# About project

This project is to demo the implementation of various file formats like WEBM(Video) OGG(Audio) WAV(Audio) MP4(Video) GLB(3D) GLTF(3D) in Reactjs.

2 main packages are used - [React Player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to support the file formats. The packages will support more formats other than implemented here.
